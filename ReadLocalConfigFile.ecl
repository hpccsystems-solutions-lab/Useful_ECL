/**
 * Loads a local file containing configuration parameters and returns those
 * parameters as a dictionary.  Configuration parameters in the file should
 * be expressed in the following format:
 *
 *      key=value
 *      key=value
 *      ...
 *      key=value
 *
 * Blank lines in the file are skipped, as well as any line that has '#' as the
 * first non-blank character.  Empty values (e.g. 'key=') are allowed.
 * Whitespace surrounding both key and value is trimmed away.
 *
 * It should be stressed that this function normally reads a local file.
 * If executed in a multi-node Thor environment, the expected file should either
 * exist on all Thor nodes or you should supply the IP address of the system
 * hosting the file.
 *
 * @param   fullPath        The full path to the configuration file; REQUIRED
 * @param   ipAddress       The IP address of the system that hosts the file
 *                          at fullPath; use '127.0.0.1' to specify the local
 *                          system; OPTIONAL, defaults to '127.0.0.1'
 *
 * @return  Parsed configuration parameters in the form of a DICTIONARY.
 *          The attributes within the dictionary are 'key' and 'value'.
 *          Both key and value are STRING data types.  If the cited file does
 *          not exist then an empty dictionary is returned.
 *          Example usage:  myParamValue := myConfig[key].value;
