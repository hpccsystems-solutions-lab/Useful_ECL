/**
 * ECL module that supports fast, inexact matching of query words against a
 * dictionary of words.  Inexact matching is useful for matching words that
 * differ by only a few characters, perhaps due to typos or transpositions.
 * Very large word sets are fully supported for both dictionary and query
 * words, making this a good big data matching solution in a distributed
 * environment like HPCC.
 *
 * The code here relies on computing the Levenshtein Distance (the
 * "edit distance") between any two words, which is informally defined as
 * the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or
 * substitutions) required to change one word into the other.  More
 * information on edit distances can be found at
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance.
 *
 * This module creates an ECL index that represents the dictionary of words.
 * Query words, either singularly or in the form of a dataset, can then
 * be quickly matched against the dictionary.  The result is a dataset
 * where each record contains a query word, a dictionary word, and the
 * actual edit distance between them.
 *
 * A maximum edit distance ("MaxED") is provided at both index creation
 * time and at search time.  Fuzzy matches with edit distances greater than
 * the search MaxED will not be returned.  The index grows dramatically
 * with higher MaxED values and longer words; a MaxED of 1 or 2 is typical
 * when matching single words.  You can use different MaxED values for index
 * creation and search; the MaxED value for search will be the limit used
 * for results.  Searching with a MaxED higher than the MaxED used to create
 * the index will return only partial results (if any) for any edit distance
 * value beyond the MaxED used for index creation, so for accuracy the MaxED
 * value you use for search should not exceed the value used to create
 * the index.
 *
 * This module supports an "adaptive edit distance" feature.  Rather than
 * setting a fixed maximum edit distance, you can supply a -1 value for the
 * MaxED parameter and the function will choose an appropriate value on a
 * per-word basis.  The value chosen will be basically, "1 for every seven
 * characters."  So, a three-character word will use a MaxED of 1, a
 * nine-character word use a MaxED of 2, and so on, up to a hardcoded
 * maximum, currently 5.
 *
 * This module provides data normalization only for the TextSearch() function,
 * where it is slightly harder to implement.  For dictionary creation and
 * the other search functions, you should prepare your data by converting the
 * strings to uppercase or lowercase, removing space runs, etc so that all
 * values are normalized as much as possible.  Exactly what normalization
 * steps you perform depend on your use-case.
 *
 * The module supports UTF-8 strings for both the dictionary and query words.
 * It uses the current locale when computing the actual edit distance between
 * two UTF-8 strings.

 * "Improved Fast Similarity Search in Dictionaries"
 * (https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1191v2).  This paper, in turn, was based on the
 * work described in "Fast Similarity Search in Large Dictionaries" by
 * Thomas Bocek, Ela Hunt, and Burkhard Stiller
 * (https://fastss.csg.uzh.ch/ifi-2007.02.pdf).
